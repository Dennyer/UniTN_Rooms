Version 1.3

Now the bot when a room is selected does NOT reply with another selection for the date, but instead you are presented with the room schedule for the same day and a button to select the day.
Another change is the fact that now the room schedule message shows the day selected.

Version 1.2

If you have only one choice when you want to look for rooms now it doesn't show the choice menu, it selects the only choice automatically
The number of columns on the text that displays the rooms changed from 2 to 3 to improve UX on mobile

Version 1.1

I decided to reduce the message where the schedule for a certain room is presented so it doesn't take the whole screen.

Version 1.0

All basic function are there and the bot works.
